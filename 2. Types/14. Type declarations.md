# Type declarations

Type declarations can be added to function arguments, return values, and, as of PHP 7.4.0, class properties. They ensure that the value is of the specified type at call time, otherwise a TypeError is thrown. 

```
public function updateUser(School $school) {
	
}
```

In the example above you can see that a varibale has been passed into the function. But it has has a Type. This is called Type declaration, it ensures that this variables is of a particular type. In this intance School $school is of type class/object.
